# scorecard
This is the scorecard I've created for reviewing good/bad behaviour.
It is created using code provided in the worskhop for which it was made. 
Notable differences between the two scorecard realisations are 
the fact that I've tried to implement logistic regression.
I have also used different categorical variables which upon using dummy variables and then
training the model predicted different ranges of estimation.
